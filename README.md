# **Tetris-in-Java**

* This is a simple Tetris program in Java.

### Getting started

* Clone or download all the files and open them with your favorite IDE that compiles Java. (I use eclipse as my IDE)
* Compile and run the file: `Tetris.java`. Now you'll see the program running.

### Controlling blocks

* There are four options for you to control the falling block:
  * Press `W` to rotate the block clock-wise.
  * Press `A` to move the block a unit left.
  * Press `D` to move the block a unit right.
  * Press `S` to let the block directly fall down.

### Scoring

* Whenever a row is filled with blocks, that particular row will be cleaned. Meanwhile, all blocks above that row will fall down one unit accordingly and you'll receive 100 points.
